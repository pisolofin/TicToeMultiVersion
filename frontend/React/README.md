# React

## Configuration

### Using shared models and services

React ( in default confifuration ) compile only files inside `src` folder for default configuration.
To use files inside `shared` folder outside React project I used `copyfiles` npm package to copy outside `shared` folder inside `src` folder.

Testing other state manager in React. In `/tic-toe-observable` there is same tic-toe application but with Observable state manager.
